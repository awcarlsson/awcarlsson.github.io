    <p>Software engineer at Amazon. Previously, I completed my undergraduate in computer science & math at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
    <p>In my free time I like listening to music (current favorite genres are techno, breakbeat, house, ambient, indie rock, folk). 
        I'm very interested in history and geography. 
        Travelling is one of my favorite activities, so far I have been to: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, Mexico, Canada, St. Lucia, USA. 
        I'll be going to Ecuador in December 2023 and Iceland/Sweden in 2024. 
        I'm broadly interested in ML/AI developments and technological progress in general. 
    I enjoy skiing in the winter. Currently trying to improve at chess, mahjong, and CS2. Also learning Swedish and occasionally guitar.</p>
    <p>Living in Seattle, Washington.</p>
